Brief Description: We are given a design, and we are to recreate the design using bootstrap componenets and elements. We also had to include responsiveness for tablet and mobile.
Peer Review: Alexander Soria: The site is nearly accurate to the original mockup. If anything, it does get a little screwy once you compare it to the standard resolution, as the Check Avaliability button is on another row, and the background image for the hook is slightly off. Some of the font sizes could be slightly adjusted in order to properly set it up to how the mockup is set up like. Everything else is very good, though. A big standout is how you managed to move the logo on the top to the top left and have all the nav bar items in a dropdown menu.
